<h2>August 1, Saturday, Exercises</h2>
<h3>Know myself</h3>
<p>In this exercise, each one of you will create a personal webpage. This webpage
will include 3 things : your <strong>name</strong>, your <strong>picture</strong>, and a short <strong>bio</strong>
of yours. Here's how we will go about doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First you will write down the above three pieces of information in a regular
  <code>.txt</code> file</li>
<li>Then, you will add some HTML to this <code>.txt</code> file and save it as a <code>.html</code> file. 
  Once you do that, you will be able to view the webpage in your browser. </li>
<li>But the webpage will not look too nice, because we haven't added any styling yet.
  Hence, in this step, you will create a new file that ends in <code>.css</code> and add
  some CSS code to it.</li>
<li>And lastly, you will <em>link</em> the <code>.html</code> and the <code>.css</code> files you created, to
  view the final, nicely styled version of your webpage. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Know my group</h3>
<p>Now we all know that websites generally do not have single pages; it's actually
a collection of pages <em>linked</em> together. So that's what we're going to do here.
You will email the webpage that you created in the previous exercise (i.e. you
will email both the <code>.html</code> and the <code>.css</code> files) to everyone else in your
group.</p>
<p>So now, everyone has 5/6 different webpages. At this stage, what you'll do is,
you'll go to your original webpage, and add <em>links</em> on it to these other
webpages that you just received from your group members via email. </p>
<h3>Let's play</h3>
<p>And finally, for our last exercise of the day, we will write a little Python
program to simulate something you've all probably learned in Physics/Chemistry:
<strong>brownian</strong> motion. What happens when you put a drop of ink in a glass of
water? The ink particles randomly disperse through the water. Our program is
going to simulate the random motion of one such particle.</p>
<p>We will assume that at the start (when the drop of ink has <em>just</em> landed in
the glass of water), the position of the particle is [0, 0] (origin). Then, at each
step, the particle can either move 1 unit North, 1 unit South, 1 unit East,
or 1 unit West. Because it's motion is random, it can go North, South, East, 
or West with equal probability.</p>
<p>Say it went 1 unit North in its first step. Then, the position of the particle
after the first step would be [0, 1]. Say it went 1 unit West in the second
step. Then, its position would become [-1, 1]. Say it went 1 unit East in the
third step. Then, its position would become [0, 1]. </p>
<p>Can you write a program which will simulate such motion for a large number of
steps (such as 100, 500, 1000, etc) and tell you the distance of the ink particle
from the origin at the end? </p>	</body>
