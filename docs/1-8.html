<h1>August 1, Saturday</h1>

<h2>10:40 am - 1:40 pm</h2>

<p>We are going to do some small, fun, coding exercises so that each one of you
can get a feel for it and can see for yourself how interesting it is!</p>

<h3>Know myself</h3>

<p>In this exercise, each one of you will create a personal webpage. This webpage
will include 3 things : your <strong>name</strong>, your <strong>picture</strong>, and a short <strong>bio</strong>
of yours. Here's how we will go about doing this:</p>

<ul>
<li>First you will write down the above three pieces of information in a regular
<code>.txt</code> file</li>
<li>Then, you will add some HTML to this <code>.txt</code> file and save it as a <code>.html</code> file. 
Once you do that, you will be able to view the webpage in your browser. </li>
<li>But the webpage will not look too nice, because we haven't added any styling yet.
Hence, in this step, you will create a new file that ends in <code>.css</code> and add
some CSS code to it.</li>
<li>And lastly, you will <em>link</em> the <code>.html</code> and the <code>.css</code> files you created, to
view the final, nicely styled version of your webpage. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Know my group</h3>

<p>Now we all know that websites generally do not have single pages; it's actually
a collection of pages <em>linked</em> together. So that's what we're going to do here.
You will email the webpage that you created in the previous exercise (i.e. you
will email both the <code>.html</code> and the <code>.css</code> files) to everyone else in your
group.</p>

<p>So now, everyone has 5/6 different webpages. At this stage, what you'll do is,
you'll go to your original webpage, and add <em>links</em> on it to these other
webpages that you just received from your group members via email. </p>
