### Beginning eDiary

Today we will actually start writing the online diary. 
We will not be creating the *whole* diary from scratch, because
there are still some things that you need to learn before you can
create an entire application from scratch. So what we will do is
we will give you some starter code on top of which
you will write your own code to complete the diary. But we will also
explain you *how* the starter code works, so that you gain the knowledge
of building an entire application from scratch! 

Please download the [starter code](../starter.zip) before the workshop
if you can. Look at this [help document](help.html) to understand what the starter code contains and
how you're going to use/edit it.
