### Know myself

In this exercise, each one of you will create a personal webpage. This webpage
will include 3 things : your **name**, your **picture**, and a short **bio**
of yours. Here's how we will go about doing this:

- First you will write down the above three pieces of information in a regular
  `.txt` file
- Then, you will add some HTML to this `.txt` file and save it as a `.html` file. 
  Once you do that, you will be able to view the webpage in your browser. 
- But the webpage will not look too nice, because we haven't added any styling yet.
  Hence, in this step, you will create a new file that ends in `.css` and add
  some CSS code to it.
- And lastly, you will *link* the `.html` and the `.css` files you created, to
  view the final, nicely styled version of your webpage. 

### Know my group

Now we all know that websites generally do not have single pages; it's actually
a collection of pages *linked* together. So that's what we're going to do here.
You will email the webpage that you created in the previous exercise (i.e. you
will email both the `.html` and the `.css` files) to everyone else in your
group.

So now, everyone has 5/6 different webpages. At this stage, what you'll do is,
you'll go to your original webpage, and add *links* on it to these other
webpages that you just received from your group members via email. 

### Let's play
