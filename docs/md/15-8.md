### Re-intro of Python

- As we told you last time, we will supply you with an `isPrime` machine.
  That machine is present in [`prime.py`](../prime/prime.py)
- You just have to download `prime.py` and keep it in the same folder as all
  your Python files. You do not need to edit it, and neither do you need to
  understand how it works. 
- The Python program that we wrote in the last workshop is available here: 
  [`count.py`](../prime/count.py)
- Just download it, and keep it open. We are going to do some recap and make
  sure everyone understands how it works

### Improving `count.py` to do other useful things

### Now we know HTML/CSS/Python. How do we connect them to make apps?
