<h2>Explaining the starter code</h2>

<p>This is the help document for the eDiary application that you're
going to create. It explains what you'll find in the starter code pack (once you extract it).
Please read this before touching any of the files in this starter pack.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>As you can see, there are three Python files.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>bottle.py</code></li>
<li><code>db.py</code></li>
<li><code>server.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to touch <code>bottle.py</code> or <code>db.py</code>. You do have to edit
<code>server.py</code> to complete the diary.</p>

<p><code>bottle.py</code> is a very large Python file written by some really good programmers and
available for free on the internet at www.bottlepy.org. We have
downloaded it here for you just for convenience. It contains some
very useful functions that we will be using in writing our application.</p>

<p><code>db.py</code> is a small Python file that we (Parth, Brijesh, Darvish) have written.
It also contains some useful functions that you will be using when you
write your own code in <code>server.py</code>.</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>

<p>If you look at the <code>views/</code> folder, you will see two files in there.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>home.tpl</code></li>
<li><code>signin.tpl</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These file have the extension <code>.tpl</code>, but they are in effect HTML files only.
You will be editing both these while creating the diary.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<p>If you look at the static/ folder, you will see two files in there too.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>style.css</code></li>
<li><code>diary.png</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>diary.png</code> is a simple picture file and contains the logo of the diary. So
obviously you're not supposed to edit it or anything.</p>

<p><code>style.css</code> is the CSS file the entire diary application, and right now it
contains a lot of styling rules. Because styling is very subjective and
depends from person to person, we're going to allow you to modify this file
in whichever way you like.</p>

<p>Also one more thing to note. The <code>style.css</code> file has been put together very
fast, and consequently you might find it a little bit disorganized or
jumbled up. We apologize for that. We're sure many of you will be able to
write more coherent, understandable styling rules on your own for the diary.</p>

<h3>Other Files/Folders</h3>

<p>Do not worry about those. We will tell you what they are and what to do with
them during the workshop. :)</p>
